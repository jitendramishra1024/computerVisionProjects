Contains computer vision projects 

01.DETECT A SMILE ALONG WITH FACE FROM WEBCAM


   This contains below things 
   
   
   A. Basic Reading and writing of image Using Open CV
   
   B. Provided an image detect whether the subect is smiling or not , detects eyes and face as well 
   
   C. Detection of image face and smile from web cam 
   
   D.Detection of Cars from video 
   
   E.Detection of full body i.e people walking on the road 
   
 02. ROCK PAPER SCISSOR
 
   GOAL is to predict a given gesture is rock paper scissor or any other image 
   
   Training data :
   https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1BeWxn4wd2t7Idx6G8XFhQuSQ5bxW-25n?usp=sharing

   CONTENTS: The dataset contains a total of 2188 images corresponding to the 
   'Rock' (726 images), 
   'Paper' (710 images) and 
   'Scissors' (752 images) 
   hand gestures of the Rock-Paper-Scissors game. All image are taken on a green background with relatively consistent ligithing and        white balance.

   FORMAT: All images are RGB images of 300 pixels wide by 200 pixels high in .png format. The images are separated in three sub-folders named 'rock', 'paper' and 'scissors' according to their respective class.
   
   We have one folder for individual prediction as well
   How to use :
   1. To train the model 
   put dataset.zip in MyDrive/colabNotebooks
   and run RPS_Classifier_CNN .ipynb
   2.To do individual prediction 
   use  rps_individual_prediction folder  in google MyDrive/colabNotebooks
   3.To predict using saved model 
   use RPS_Individual_prediction
   
03. Rock paper scissor game using webcam 

Details we will go after leraning transfer leraning
